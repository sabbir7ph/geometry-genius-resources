                                <span>javaScript basically doesn't recognize Html elements. That we can convert html
                                    elements to javascript with the help of DOM. Dom is a programming interface language
                                    that represents the html document model as a tree.
                                    One of the main reasons for developing the DOM is to maintain a standard programming
                                    interface for HTML and XML documents, which is language-independent. Setting and
                                    maintaining this standard enables programmers to create or navigate these types of
                                    documents and modify their elements predictably, using any type of language or
                                    development environment.
                                    Having said that, JavaScript language is arguably one of the most popular ways of
                                    working with HTML documents using the DOM.

                                <span>JavaScript is most commonly used to get or modify the content or value of the HTML
                                    elements on the page, as well as to apply some effects like show, hide, animations
                                    etc. But, before you can perform any action you need to find or select the target
                                    HTML element.

                                    In the following sections, you will see some of the common ways of selecting the
                                    elements on a page and do something with them using the JavaScript.

                                <span>Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model). It happens when an
                                    element receives an event, and that event bubbles up (or you can say is transmitted
                                    or propagated) to its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets to
                                    the root element.</span>

                                <span>CallBack Function: In the JavaScript world, a callback is a function passed into
                                    another function as an argument and it will be executed later.

                                    Why I use: Most of the time we create programs and applications that work
                                    synchronously. In other words, some of our operations begin as soon as the previous
                                    tasks are completed.
                                    In this case, we want to wait for a response, but we donâ€™t always want our entire
                                    application to stop when we fetch our data. Callback functions come in handy in such
                                    situations.</span>
